    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sippy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 2, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Sippy ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our cocktail recipe application handles information.</p>
    
    <h2>Age Restriction</h2>
    <p>Sippy contains content related to alcoholic beverages and is intended for users aged 21 and older. Upon first launch, users are required to verify they meet the minimum age requirement. This verification is stored locally on your device only.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>Sippy does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. All data is stored locally on your device using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your preferences, favorites, ratings, custom collections, and age verification status are stored only on your device using SharedPreferences (Android) or similar local storage mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> The app does not require user registration or account creation.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics tools or tracking services.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> Your data is never shared with third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>External Data Sources</h2>
    <p>Sippy retrieves cocktail recipes and images from TheCocktailDB (www.thecocktaildb.com), a free public API. When you use the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The app makes requests to TheCocktailDB to fetch recipe data</li>
        <li>Images are loaded from TheCocktailDB servers and cached locally on your device</li>
        <li>No personal information is sent in these requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TheCocktailDB's data handling is governed by their own privacy policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permission:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> Required to fetch cocktail recipes and images from TheCocktailDB API.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you maintain full control over it. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data (favorites, ratings, collections) will be removed from your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Sippy is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 21. We do not knowingly collect information from users under 21.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
